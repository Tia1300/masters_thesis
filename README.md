# Multivariate Limit Theorems and Algebraic Generating Functions
This repository contains code associated with the author's Master's Thesis, "Multivariate Limit Theorems and Algebraic Generating Functions".

The code in this repository is separated into three files. The first file, "Central Limit Theorems via Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables - Companion Notebook", serves two purposes. First, it is a companion notebook
